\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

  First and foremost I would like to thank my supervisor Owe Philipsen, for
  letting me come to Frankfurt, for giving me a very interesting project to
  work on, and for letting me approach it in my own whimsical way.

  I would also like to extend a thank you to the entire working group, who has
  made my stay here a pleasant one. A special thanks to the interesting people I
  have had the pleasure of sharing an office with, and for enduring my presence.

  Without the support of my friends and family in Norway, I would be a very
  different place than I am today, and for that I am forever grateful.

  Finally a big thank you to my friends who proofread this thesis; Christopher
  \mbox{Kolbjørnsen}, Mathias Neuman, Jonas Scheunert, Inga Strümke and Savvas
  Zaferopoulos.
