\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Acknowledgements}

First and foremost I would like to thank my supervisor Owe Philipsen, for
letting me come to Frankfurt, for giving me a very interesting project to
work on, and for letting me approach it in my own whimsical way.

\vskip .2cm
I would also like to extend a thank you to the entire working group, who has
made my stay here a pleasant one. A special thanks to the interesting people I
have had the pleasure of sharing an office with, and for enduring my presence.

\vskip .2cm
I am forever grateful to my friends and family in Norway, without whom I would
be a very different person than I am today.

Finally, a big thank you to my friends who helped proofread this thesis; Christopher
\mbox{Kolbjørnsen}, Mathias Neuman, Jonas Scheunert, Inga Strümke and Savvas
Zafeiropoulos. As well as additional thanks to Bj\"orn Wagenbach for translating
the German summary.
