\chapter{Introduction}

The current state of human knowledge suggests that the majority of the visible
matter in the universe is made up of hadrons that are themselves build up from
quarks and gluons. We have so far discovered six species, or flavours, of quarks,
namely the up, down, strange, charm, top and bottom. These fundamental particles
carry three sets of charges: electric charge, flavour charge and colour charge.
It is the latter of these that manifest itself through the confinement process
that binds the quarks together into inseparable hadrons, and the resulting
binding energy is responsible for almost 99 \% of the mass of these bound
particles. For example the proton weights 938.27 MeV, while its constituents,
two up quarks and a single down quark, have a total rest mass of no more than
9.8 (1.9) MeV \citep{Agashe:2014kda}.
