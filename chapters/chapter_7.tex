\chapter{Research Perspectives}

Although we have answered many questions regarding the properties and
applications of the effective theory in this thesis, we have also asked new
ones, and been organically lead onto the path of new research. First and
foremost, applications of the effective theory to large-$N_c$ studies, opening
up communication with the supersymmetry community was elaborated in
\secref{sec:large_nc_study}. Also, the application of the analytic expressions
to studies of Yang Lee zeros was outlined.

On top of this, questions regarding the nature of the continuum extrapolated
results remain unanswered, and further research is in order. One possible avenue
of future investigation, is a more thorough analysis of the analytic
contributions to the effect. Another could be reached through the large-$N_c$
study, as the \emph{polyquark} states have different statistical properties
depending on the gauge group. Finally one could explore the corrections to the
ground state energy of the different quark states, and see if it is possible to
manipulate the degrees of freedom in such a way that the continuum physics
alter, following predictable patterns.

Another future research prospect is the computation of susceptibilities, such as
Polyakov loop susceptibilities. These quantities are a paramount ingredient in
the study of phase transitions for series expansion studies. The linked cluster
method propose a systematic way of computing these quantities in the
thermodynamic limit, and is given by the set of $n$-rooted graphs with
connectivity properties depending on the variable of study. We believe that
these can be extended to the polymer linked cluster in a straightforward manner,
and should prove immediately beneficial to our continued efforts.

Other projects using the same formalism has already been initiated in our
working group, such as the study of isospin chemical potential. This was already
explored with the $\mathcal{O}(\kappa^4)$ effective theory action in
\citep{Langelage:2014vpa} using numerical methods. This can be extended to the
realm of analytics by applying the methods outline in this thesis. Another
project also in progress is the evaluation of the canonical partition function
constructed through Fourier transform of the effective theory grand canonical
partition function. This could provide an additional extraction point for the
nucleon binding energy, which is still a future goal. It could also help
illuminate the question of the nature of our continuum physics.

On top of all of this, we have seen that resummation schemes, and systematic
improvement of the theory are more important than order by order results. Effort
should therefore be put towards the development of these methods. This includes
applying the cluster expansion resummation strategy, and looking to it for
inspiration when devising resummation formulas on the level of the effective
action. Recursive improvement patterns are also of great interest, such as
course graining techniques. Finally, we have so far based the study on an
unimproved Wilson fermion action. Order $a$ improvement schemes are therefore
massively helpful in reducing continuum extrapolation errors.

All in all, we conclude that the field is healthy, and is currently being
adopted by other groups, showing a broader interest, and faith in the approach
\citep{Scior:2015vra,Scior:2016fso,Rindlisbacher:2015pea}.
