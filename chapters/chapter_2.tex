\chapter{Gauge Theories and Lattice Gauge Theories}

In this chapter we will formally introduce the quantum field theory describing
fermions invariant under local group transformations and introduce the Yang
Mills Lagrangian. This is covered in \secref{sec-continuum_gauge}. We follow
this up in \secref{sec-group_intro} with a brief overview of basic group theory,
introducing the concepts and tools necessary for the thesis. In
\secref{sec-symmetries} we investigate the defining symmetry properties of our
quantum field theory. After this introduction to continuum physics, in
\secref{sec-lattice_intro} we discretise space-time and put our theory on a
lattice. In the \secrefs{sec-fermion_doubling,sec-scale_setting}
we review the similarities and differences between the lattice and the
continuum, and stress where additional care has to be taken. Finally we give a
very quick introduction to numerical evaluation of lattice theories in
\secref{sec-numerical_eval}.

For the introduction, standard texts on the subject matter has been consulted.
Such as introductory volumes on quantum field theory
\citep[e.g.][]{peskin1995introduction,maggiore2004modern}, lattice gauge theory
\citep[e.g.][]{montvay1997quantum,gattringer2009quantum} and group theory
\citep[e.g.][]{georgi1999lie,fulton2013representation}.

\section{The free Dirac Lagrangian} \label{sec-continuum_gauge}

The undoubtaly most important quantity in Quantum Field Theory (\emph{QFT}) and
Statistical Mechanics (\emph{SM}) is $\mathcal{Z}$, named the generating
functional and the partition function in the two theories respectively. It is in
SM defined as
%
\begin{equation} \label{eq-partition}
  \mathcal{Z}_E = \int \prod_i \mathrm{d} \phi_i e^{-\mathcal{S}_E[\phi_i]},
\end{equation}
%
where we have represented the field parameters by $\phi_i$. There is an analogue
between the two theories and one can convert between them by Wick rotating the
time coordinate $x^0_E = -i x^0_M$. Whenever the possibility for confusion
exists we use an $M$ to symbolise Minkowski space, the world of QFT, and an $E$
to symbolise Euclidean space, the world of SM.

The action, $\mathcal{S}$, is in turn defined by the Lagrangian density
%
\begin{equation} \label{eq-action-def}
  \mathcal{S}[\phi_i] = \int \mathrm{d}^4 x\, \mathcal{L}[\phi_i(x)],
\end{equation}
%
and our theories are therefore uniquely defined through $\mathcal{L}$ and the
properties of the fields $\phi_i$.

Of physical interest are expectation values of Hermitian operators $O$, defined
as
%
\begin{equation} \label{eq-expectation_value}
  \big\langle O[\phi_i] \big\rangle = \frac{1}{\mathcal{Z}_E} 
    \int \prod_i \mathrm{d} \phi_i \, O[\phi_i]\, e^{-\mathcal{S}_E[\phi_i]}
\end{equation}
%
which correspond to physical observables. These can for example be accessed by
the introduction of source terms
%
% TODO Consider whether I need this
%
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{Z}_E [\,J_i\,] = \int \prod_i \mathrm{d} \phi_i \,
    e^{-\mathcal{S}_E[\phi_i] - \int J_i \phi_i}
\end{equation}
%
with which we can rewrite the expectation value in terms of functional
derivatives
%
\begin{equation}
  \big\langle O[\phi_i] \big\rangle = O\bigg[ \frac{\delta}{\delta J_i} \bigg]
    \log \mathcal{Z}_E \bigg|_{J=0},
\end{equation}
%
hence the name generating functional.

\subsection{The Dirac Lagrangian}

The most basic starting point for us will be the Dirac Lagrangian, which reads
%
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{L} = \bar{\psi}_i \big(i\gamma^{\mu} \partial_{\mu} - m_i\big)
  \psi_i. \label{eq-ldirac}
\end{equation}
%
where we have introduced the fermionic fields $\psi_i$. To get the right
statistics, these fields have to obey the anti-commutation relations, placing
them in the group known as Grassmann numbers
%
\begin{align}
  \big\{ \psi_i, \psi_j \big\} &\equiv \psi_i \psi_j + \psi_j \psi_i = 0,\\
  \big\{ \bar{\psi}_i, \bar{\psi}_j \big\} &\equiv \bar{\psi}_i \bar{\psi}_j +
    \bar{\psi}_j \bar{\psi}_i = 0,\\
  \big\{ \bar{\psi}_i, \psi_j \big\} &\equiv \bar{\psi}_i \psi_j + \psi_j
    \bar{\psi}_i = \delta_{ij}.
\end{align}

This Lagrangian describe the dynamics of a set of free, massive fermions, which
is not very exciting. There are a multitude of ways to add interactions while
still maintaining the desired symmetry properties (which we will discuss later).
One is to add a self interaction term, e.g. a four point term, $g
\big(\bar{\psi}\psi\big)^2$, which results in the NJL model
\citep{Nambu:1961tp}. Another option is to introduce more fields and
interactions. Finally one can localise the symmetries of the fields and induce
new fields and couplings. For this procedure we need a short overview of group
theory which we will tackle next.

\section{A group theory perspective} \label{sec-group_intro}

A group $G$ is a set and a rule for assigning to every (ordered) pair in the set
a new element also in the set
%
\begin{equation}
  \text{For every} \hskip1ex f, g \in G, \hskip1ex\text{then}\hskip1ex
    h = fg \in G
\end{equation}
%
this assignment is called the group product. The group product is associative,
and in every group a unit element exists ($e$). Every element also has an inverse so
that
%
\begin{equation}
  \forall\hskip.5ex f \in G, \hskip1ex\exists\hskip.5ex f^{-1}
    \hskip1ex:\hskip1ex f^{-1} f = f f^{-1} = e
\end{equation}
%
A representation of a group $G$ on a complex vector space $V$ is a homomorphism
%
\begin{equation}
  D_{R}:\hskip1em G \to \text{GL}(V)
\end{equation}
%
of the group $G$ on the group of automorphisms of $V$. Therefore representations
have to maintain the group structure, meaning
%
\begin{align}
  D_R(e) &= \mathbb{1}_R,\\
  D_R(f) D_R(g) &= D_R(fg). \label{eq-group_prod}
\end{align}
%
In physics we are normally content with a coordinate basis, in which the
representations map to $n$ by $n$ invertible matrices, i.e. $V := \mathbb{C}$,
$\text{GL}(V) := M_{\mathbb{C}}(n,n)$.

\subsection{Lie groups}

If the elements of a group $G$ depend smoothly on some set of parameters,
$g(\alpha_i) \in G$, we call that group a Lie group. Lie groups make up the
theory of continuous transformations, and are therefore of special interest to
physics. The continuous nature of the Lie groups create a sense of closeness
where two elements that are close to each other can be represented through
differentials. For example
%
\begin{equation}
  D_R(g(\delta\alpha_i)) = \mathbb{1}_R + i\, \delta \alpha_i T_{Ri} +
    \mathcal{O}(\delta \alpha^2).
\end{equation}
%
One commonly refers to the $T_{Ri}$ as the generators of the group $G$. Applying
the smoothness condition to the group product, \meqref{eq-group_prod},
we find that the commutator of the generators follow a special relation
%
\begin{equation} \label{eq-group_algebra}
  \big[ T_{Ri}, T_{Rj} \big] = i\, f_{ijk} T_{Rk}.
\end{equation}
%
The structure constants, $f_{ijk}$, are in fact independent of the
representation $R$. They are tremendously important as they summarise the entire
group multiplication law. They are also referred to as the \emph{algebra} of the
group, $\mathfrak{g}$. The generators and the group algebra will come into play
when we later introduce continuous symmetries of our quantum theory of fields.
Using the Jacobi identity, it is possible to see that the structure constants
themselves follow the multiplication law. We can therefore use the structure
constants as a representation of the algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ called the
\emph{adjoint representation}
%
\begin{equation}
  \big[ T_{\text{adj}\hskip.2ex i} \big]_{jk} \equiv -i\, f_{ijk},
\end{equation}
%
which fulfils \meqref{eq-group_algebra}.

\subsection{Character and character expansion}

One defines the character of a representation as
%
\begin{equation}
  \chi_R(g) = \tr D_R(g).
\end{equation}
%
The characters appear frequently in field theory due to the cyclic properties of
the trace and its ability to facilitate the creation of invariant objects. On
top of this the characters span a basis of functions that share this cyclic
properties, i.e. any function $\rho(f g f^{-1}) = \rho(g)$. Hence
%
\begin{equation}
  \rho(g) = \sum_r \rho_r \chi_r(g),
\end{equation}
%
with
\begin{equation}
  \rho_r = \int_{\mathrlap{g \in G}\hskip1.5ex} \mathrm{d}g \, \chi_r^*(g) \rho(g).
\end{equation}
%
It is normal to factor out both the trivial representation ($D_0(g) = 1$), as
well as the dimension of the representation, and write
%
\begin{equation}
  \rho(g) = \rho_0 \Big(1 + \sum_{r \neq 0} d_r \bar{\rho}_r \chi_r(g)\Big),
\end{equation}
%
which we will refer to as the character expansion. We will make use of this in
\secref{sec-char_exp}.

\subsection{Group integrals}

Finally we need to define the integrals over the continuous groups. We introduce
the Haar integration measure, which has the following properties
%
\begin{equation}
  \int \mathrm{d}g \, \rho(g) = \int \mathrm{d}g \, \rho(fg) 
    = \int \mathrm{d}g \, \rho(gf) \hskip2ex \forall \hskip1ex f \in G
\end{equation}
%
and the normalisation
%
\begin{equation}
  \int \mathrm{d}g = 1.
\end{equation}
%
During the derivation of the effective theory, we will encounter polynomial
integrals on the form
%
\begin{equation}
  I = \int \mathrm{d} g \, g^n (g^{-1})^m
\end{equation}
%
or more commonly, with a representation
%
\begin{equation}
  I_{i_1,j_1,...,i_n,j_n}^{k_1,l_1,...,k_m,l_m} = \int \mathrm{d} g \,
    D_R(g)_{i_1j_1} \cdots D_R(g)_{i_nj_n} D_R(g^{-1})_{k_1l_1} \cdots D_R(g^{-1})_{k_ml_m}.
\end{equation}
%
There are multiple ways of tackling these integrals depending on the Lie group
one is interested in. For SU($N$) one can for instance decompose the integral
into generalised Euler angles \citep[as described in][]{Tilma:2004kp}, construct
generating functionals for the integrals $I_{i_1,j_1,...,i_n,j_n}^{k_1,l_1,...,k_m,l_m}$
\citep[details in][]{Creutz:1978ub}, or one can use tensor product
decompositions to write the integrals in terms of Young projectors
\citep{Myers:2014dia}. In this work a combination of the first two approaches
has been used, and extensive details are provided in
\apxrefs{sec-haar_measure,sec-character_integrals,sec-sun_integrals}.

\section{Symmetries of the Lagrangian} \label{sec-symmetries}

With the necessary formalism in place, we can discuss the symmetries of the
Lagrangian we introduced in \meqref{eq-ldirac}. We will first look at the
symmetries that come by construction before delving into possible ways of
extending the theory to be both globally and locally symmetric.

\subsection{Symmetries by construction}

Every quantum field theory is constructed to be symmetric under the full
Poincar\'{e} group, namely the group of space-time translations plus the Lorentz
transformations. 

To see the other symmetries of the Dirac Lagrangian we have to decompose the
fields into its spinorial components. Every element of $\psi_i$ in
\meqref{eq-ldirac} is a $4$ component spinor, and the $\gamma$'s $4 \times 4$
matrices. In the standard representation they take for form
%
\begin{equation}
  \psi = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix} \psi_R + \psi_L \\ \psi_R - \psi_L \end{pmatrix}, \hskip1cm
    \gamma^0 = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{pmatrix}, \hskip1ex
    \gamma^i = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & \sigma^i \\ -\sigma^i & 0 \end{pmatrix}.
\end{equation}
%
The fields $\psi_{R,L}$ are two component fields that transform under two
distinct representations of the Lorentz group, $(\frac{1}{2}, 0)$ and $(0,
\frac{1}{2})$ respectively. With this basis the Dirac Lagrangian reads
%
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{L} = i \bar{\psi}_R \gamma^{\mu}\partial_{\mu} \psi_R
    + i \bar{\psi}_L \gamma^{\mu}\partial_{\mu} \psi_L
    - m (\bar{\psi}_R\psi_L + \bar{\psi}_L\psi_R).
\end{equation}
%
It is apparent that this Lagrangian is symmetric under the U($1$) $\otimes$ U($1$)
transformation
%
\begin{equation} \label{eq-chiral_transformation}
  \psi_{R,L} \to e^{i \alpha_{R,L}} \psi_{R,L}
\end{equation}
%
if and only if the mass term is set to zero. Invariance of the independent
transformations of the left- and right handed fields is called \emph{chiral}
symmetry, and signal the existence of helicity eigenstates. The mass term breaks
the symmetry into a single U($1$) symmetry, where $\alpha_R = \alpha_L$.

The global symmetry group of $\psi$ can be trivially extended to admit any Lie
group by making the field live in the vector space the representation acts on 
%
\begin{equation} \label{eq-global_trafo}
  \psi \to D_R(g) \psi, \hskip1em \bar{\psi} \to \bar{\psi} D_R^{\dagger}(g),
  \hskip1em g \in G.
\end{equation}
%
This symmetry has an associated conserved Noether current for every generator of
the group $G$
%
\begin{equation}
  j^{\mu}_i = \bar{\psi} \gamma^{\mu} T_i \psi, \hskip1ex\text{where}\hskip1ex
    \partial_{\mu}j^{\mu}_i = 0,
\end{equation}
%
which gives the associated charge
%
\begin{equation} \label{eq-noether-charge}
  Q_i = \int \mathrm{d}^3 x\, \bar{\psi} \gamma^0 T_i \psi.
\end{equation}

\subsection{Gauge symmetries}

We just saw that the Lagrangian can be trivially extended to be invariant under
global symmetry transformations. However, we also want to promote them to local
symmetries. This is motivated post facto by QED, which exhibits a local U($1$)
symmetry.

The idea was first explored by Weyl, who tried introducing local scale
transformations to the metric
%
\begin{equation}
  g_{\mu\nu}(x) \to e^{\sigma(x)}g_{\mu\nu}(x)
\end{equation}
%
which prompted the need for an additional vector field to gauge how much one
needs to adjust scales to compare two separate points. Weyl then showed that
these vector fields need to follow Maxwell's equations, and postulated that
these gauge fields were in fact nothing else than Maxwell's electromagnetic
potentials \citep{Weyl:1918ib}. It was later discovered that classically scale
invariant theories looses this symmetry due to a quantum effect sometimes
referred to as the \emph{Weyl anomaly}. In fact, it is this very effect that is
responsible for the bulk contribution to the hadron masses in QCD. So, although
Weyl's ideas does not describe how the world actually works, it served as a
cornerstone on which the theories connecting the geometry of space to local
symmetries was built. Instead of adjusting local length scales, we will apply
group transformations to vector spaces that live on top of space-time.

We define a local group element by a Lie group whose parameters are space-time
dependent $g(\alpha_i(x))$. We will use the short hand notation $U(x) =
D_R\big(g(\alpha_i(x))\big)$ for representations of such group elements. We
suppress the representation $R$ wherever it is not needed. The transformations
of the fields at a single coordinate follow trivially from
\meqref{eq-global_trafo}
%
\begin{equation} \label{eq-local_trafo}
  \psi(x) \to U(x) \psi(x), \hskip1em \bar{\psi}(x) \to \bar{\psi}(x)
  U^{\dagger}(x).
\end{equation}
%
There is however no way to make derivative terms invariant under these
symmetries. This becomes obvious when writing the derivative in terms of limits
%
\begin{equation}
  \eta^{\mu} \partial_{\mu} \psi(x) = \lim_{\delta \to 0} \frac{1}{\delta} \big(
    \psi(x + \delta\eta) - \psi(x) \big)
\end{equation}
%
where $\eta^{\mu}$ is some unit vector. We have to take the difference between
fields at two different points in space-time, which transform independently
under \meqref{eq-local_trafo}. Naively calculating this difference is
nonsensical as one is allowed to choose the basis of the representation of the
different points independently, meaning that $\psi(x)$ and $\psi(y)$ can be
members of different vector spaces. We therefore introduce the parallel
transporters, $\Lambda(y,x)$, which transforms between the points $x$ and $y$ in
a smooth way \citep{Wu:1975es}. We define the \emph{covariant derivative} as
%
\begin{equation}
  \eta^{\mu} D_{\mu} \psi(x) = \lim_{\delta \to 0} \frac{1}{\delta} \big(
    \psi(x + \delta\eta) - \Lambda(x+\delta\eta,x)\psi(x) \big).
\end{equation}
%
where the transporter $\Lambda$ make sure we only compare elements of the same
vector space. These transformations are nothing but coordinate transformations
of the vector spaces, and must therefore itself be a member of the
representations on G. From this it follows that it transforms as
%
\begin{equation}
  \Lambda(y,x) \to U(y) \Lambda(y,x) U^{\dagger}(x).
\end{equation}
%
This in turn gives rise to the subsequent transformation rule for the covariant
derivative
%
\begin{equation}
  D_{\mu}\psi(x) \to U(x) D_{\mu} \psi(x),
\end{equation}
%
ensuring that terms of the form $\bar{\psi} D_{\mu} \psi$ remain invariant under
local symmetry transformations. As $\Lambda$ is a representation of $G$, we can
express it in terms of the generators of the group. This is on infinitesimal
form
%
\begin{equation}
  \Lambda(x + \delta\eta,x) = 1 + i g \delta \eta^{\mu} A^i_{\mu}(x) T_i +
    \mathcal{O}(\delta^2)
\end{equation}
%
where the $A^i_{\mu}$ have to transform as
%
\begin{equation}
  A^i_{\mu} \to A^i_{\mu} + \partial_{\mu} \alpha^i - g f^{ijk} \alpha^j A^k_{\mu}
    + \mathcal{O}(\alpha^2)
\end{equation}
%
completely independent of the representation. The local symmetric Dirac
Lagrangian therefore reads
%
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{L} = \bar{\psi}\big(i \gamma^{\mu} D_{\mu} - m\big) \psi.
\end{equation}
%
Unfortunately, without a kinetic term for the newly introduced fields
$A^i_{\mu}$, the theory would permit violently oscillating fields with no cost
in energy. This would make our theory non-renormalisiable, which we want to
avoid.  We therefore need to find a kinetic term for the fields that admits all
of our restrictions. To construct such a term it is natural to once more turn to
the parallel transporters, being the main ingredient in adjusting the kinetic
term of the fermions. Using the gauge transformation of $\Lambda$, it is easy to
see that the geometric plaquette could create such a term
%
\begin{align} \label{eq-transport_plaquette}
  U_{\mu\nu}(x) =& \Lambda(x, x + \hat{\nu} \delta)
    \Lambda(x + \hat{\nu} \delta, x + \hat{\mu} \delta + \hat{\nu} \delta) \nonumber\\
    &\hskip1em\times\Lambda(x + \hat{\mu} \delta + \hat{\nu}\delta, x + \hat{\mu} \delta)
    \Lambda(x + \hat{\mu}\delta, x)
\end{align}
%
which transforms as
%
\begin{equation}
  U_{\mu\nu}(x) \to U(x) U_{\mu\nu}(x) U^{\dagger}(x)
\end{equation}
%
and therefore $\tr U_{\mu\nu}(x)$ is invariant under local group
transformations. Expanding $U_{\mu\nu}$ in the fields $A^i_{\mu}$, we get
%
\begin{equation}
  U_{\mu\nu} = 1 + i g \delta^2 T_i \big( \partial_{\mu} A^i_{\nu} - \partial_{\nu}
  A^i_{\mu} + g f^{ijk} A^j_{\mu} A^k_{\nu} \big) + \mathcal{O}(\delta^3)
\end{equation}
%
from which we extract the term
%
\begin{equation} \label{eq-field_strength}
  F_{\mu\nu}^i = \partial_{\mu} A^i_{\nu} - \partial_{\nu}
    A^i_{\mu} + g f^{ijk} A^j_{\mu} A^k_{\nu}
\end{equation}
%
which is both invariant under the gauge transformations as well as being the
kinetic term we were looking for. The full gauge extended Lagrangian therefore
reads
%
\begin{equation} \label{eq-gauge_lagrangian}
  \mathcal{L} = \bar{\psi}\big(i \gamma^{\mu} D_{\mu} - m\big)\psi 
    - \frac{1}{4} F^i_{\mu\nu} F^{i\hskip.2ex\mu\nu}
\end{equation}

\section{Lattice discretisation} \label{sec-lattice_intro}

With the Lagrangian at hand we want to actually evaluate the partition function
integral from \meqref{eq-partition}. The integral is however infinite
dimensional, and has no known closed analytical form unless the theory is
trivial (non interacting). If the theory is close to being trivial, one can
apply perturbation theory and systematically solve the integral order by order.
This is however not the case for the theories we plan to study, and we must
resort to other means.

In the lattice approach one discretise space-time into a grid, or lattice,
restricting the fields and variables only to exist at these points. We thus
introduce a shortest distance, namely the spacing between these grid points,
commonly named $a$. The coordinates are thus restricted to
%
\begin{equation}
  \big(x_0, x_1, x_2, x_3\big) \in \mathbb{R}^4 
  \hskip1ex\to\hskip1ex \big(n_0, n_1, n_2, n_3\big) \in
    \raisebox{.1ex}{\scalebox{0.9}{$\big\{0, 1, ..., N-1\big\}^4$}}.
\end{equation}
%
On top of having a shortest distance, which works as a natural regulariser for
this approach, we also have a finite volume $\Omega = a^4 N^4$. Therefore, to
recover physical results, we need to take the continuum limit, $a \to 0$, and the
infinite volume limit, $N \to 0$, in such a way that $\Omega$ is large enough in
physical units to encompass the scales we are interested in studying.

Having introduced the lattice, we see that the partition function of the
discretised theory is simplified compared to the continuum. The simplification
is not obvious as it quietly changes the number of integrals from being infinite
to being a finite, albeit still large number.

In this and the following sections we will first construct a Lagrangian to put
on the lattice and analyse its new symmetry properties. We will then briefly
discuss how to determine the lattice scale and compare lattice results with
continuum physics. Finally a brief overview of the real world computations and
applications of lattice gauge theories will be given.

\subsection{The lattice gauge theory Lagrangian}

Constructing a \emph{good} discretised Lagrangian is both a subject and an art
of itself. Naively one would think that any Lagrangian that reduces to the
continuum Lagrangian \eqref{eq-gauge_lagrangian} when we send $a \to 0$ would
suffice. Or broader, Lagrangians that at most introduce total derivates with 
vanishing borders when $a \to 0$. Though this is to some extent true, we will
see that as always, the devil are in the details, and if one does not take great
care, the continuum theory will not be as it first appears.

In the previous section we introduced the parallel transporters to define how to
associate two different points in space that can belong to different vector
spaces. This procedure fits nicely only the lattice as the only modification we
have to make to the definition of the covariant derivative on the lattice is to
replace $\delta$ by $a$, and not take the limit. We will exclusively use the
transporter between nearest neighbour lattice sites, and therefore make the
abbreviation $U(x + a \eta_\mu, x) = U_{\mu}(x) =
U_{-\mu}^{\dagger}(x+a\eta_{\mu})$. With this the fermion contribution to the
lattice action with a symmetrised derivative reads
%
\begin{equation} \label{eq-naive_fermions}
  \mathcal{S}_f = a^4 \sum_x \Big( 
    m \bar{\psi}(x)\psi(x) - 
    \frac{1}{2a}\sum_{\mu=\pm 1}^{\pm 4}
    \bar{\psi}(x+\hat{\mu})\gamma^{\mu}U_{\mu}(x) \psi(x) \bigg),
\end{equation}
%
where the sum goes over the discrete points on the lattice. We have also
switched to Euclidean space, which is a conscious choice that will benefit us
later, and used the shorthand definition $\gamma^{-\mu} \equiv -\gamma^{\mu}$.
Including the gauge field is even easier as we can use the plaquette transporter
we defined in \meqref{eq-transport_plaquette}. This defines the Wilson gauge
action
%
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{S}_g = \beta_R a^4 \sum_x \sum_{\mu < \nu} \Big( 1 -
    \textstyle\frac{1}{d_R} \hskip.2ex \text{Re} \tr U_{R \hskip.2ex\mu\nu}(x) \Big),
\end{equation}
%
where $d_R$ is the dimension of the representation, $d_R = \tr D_R(e)$. $\beta_R$ is the
coupling constant, and by comparison with the continuum field strength tensor
\eqref{eq-field_strength}, we find
%
\begin{equation}
  \beta_R = \frac{2 d_R}{g^2}
\end{equation}

\section{Fermion doubling and chiral symmetry} \label{sec-fermion_doubling}

Although the Lagrangian \meqref{eq-naive_fermions} have the desired
transformation property, and reproduce the Dirac Lagrangian in the continuum, it
suffers from a degeneracy in its energy eigenvalues. The easiest way to see this
is by choosing the trivial representation of the gauge fields and writing down
the fermion Hamiltonian
%
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{H}_f = \sum_{\vec{x}} \bigg(
    m \bar{\psi}(\vec{x}) \psi(\vec{x}) + \frac{i}{2a} \sum_{k=1}^3 \Big(
      \bar{\psi}(\vec{x}+\hat{k})\gamma^k\psi(\vec{x}) 
      -\bar{\psi}(\vec{x}-\hat{k})\gamma^k\psi(\vec{x})\Big)\bigg).
\end{equation}
%
From experience we know that the free Hamiltonian is diagonal in momentum space,
so we introduce a Fourier transform
%
\begin{equation}
  \tilde{\psi}(\vec{p}) = a^3 \sum_{\vec{x}} e^{-i \vec{p}\cdot \vec{x}}
    \psi(\vec{x})
\end{equation}
%
where the possible values of $\vec{p}$ are restricted to the Brillouin zones
%
\begin{equation}
  p_i = \frac{2\pi}{a N} \nu_i, \hskip1ex \nu_i \in
    \big\{\textstyle\minus{}\big(\frac{L}{2}\minus{}1\big), ...,
    \frac{L}{2} \big\} \hskip1ex\Rightarrow\hskip1ex p_i \in \big(\minus\pi, \pi\,\big].
\end{equation}
%
After the Fourier transform the Hamiltonian is
%
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{H}_f = \frac{1}{(aN)^3}\sum_{\vec{p}} \tilde{\bar{\psi}}(\vec{p})
    \Big( m + \frac{1}{a} \gamma^k \sin (a p_k) \Big) \tilde{\psi}(\vec{p}).
\end{equation}
%
It can easily be seen that it has eigenvalues
%
\begin{equation}
  H_{\vec{p}} = \pm \sqrt{m^2 + \frac{1}{a^2} \sum_{k=1}^3 \sin^2 (a p_k)}
\end{equation}
%
which for every momentum $\vec{p}$ is $8$-fold degenerate, owing to the
periodicity of the sine function. This implies that we have $7$ additional,
unwanted, fermions in the theory whenever we put $1$ in. These \emph{doublers}
come from the corners of the Brillouin zone, and therefore disappear as we go
to the continuum limit. That is however of little comfort as they would give
incalculable effects to loop diagrams at finite volumes which cannot easily be
factored out.

\subsection{Wilson fermions}

In a quest to resolve this issue Wilson introduced an additional term to the
Lagrangian in the form of a second order derivative. This new term,
appropriately named the \emph{Wilson term}, is one order higher in $a$, and therefore
disappears in the continuum. After some shuffling of the terms, adding the
Wilson term to the Lagrangian gives us
%
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{S}_{f,w} = a^4 \sum_{x} \bigg(
  \big(m + {\textstyle\frac{4 r}{a}}\big) \bar{\psi}(x) \psi(x)
  - \frac{1}{2a} \sum_{\mu = \pm 1}^{\pm 4} \bar{\psi}(x+\hat{\mu}) (r +
  \gamma^{\mu}) U_{\mu}(x) \psi(x) \bigg).
\end{equation}
%
We have introduced the \emph{Wilson parameter} $r$, which has to be in the
interval $(0, 1]$, and is commonly chosen to be $1$. From this one can calculate
the Hamiltonian's eigenvalues, and show that have been modified to be
%
\begin{equation}
  H_{\vec{p}} = \pm \sqrt{\bigg(m + \frac{r}{a}\sum_{k=1}^3 (1 - \cos (a p_k) ) \bigg)^2
    + \frac{1}{a^2} \sum_{k=1}^3 \sin^2 (a p_k)}.
\end{equation}
%
The addition of the Wilson term has given an additional mass of $n r/a$ to the
unwanted doublers, meaning that they properly decouple from the theory in the
continuum where their masses diverge. 

%TODO: Rewrite
However, including the Wilson term does not come without a cost. By
introducing the Wilson term we explicitly break chiral symmetry, meaning that
even with $m=0$, the transformation \eqref{eq-chiral_transformation} is no
longer a symmetry of the system. 

There is in fact a theorem by Nielsen and Ninomiya
\citep{Nielsen:1980rz,Nielsen:1981xu} which states that one cannot have a lattice
theory both chirally symmetric and free of doublers at the same time with a
Dirac Lagrangian that is also local.

Yet all hope is not lost as Ginsparg and Wilson shortly after stated a modified
equation the fermion propagator has to fulfil to give a chiral theory in the
continuum \citep{Ginsparg:1981bj}. Although Wilson fermions do not meet these
requirements, solutions to these equations have since been found. Two notable
discretisation schemes being \emph{domain wall fermions} \citep{Kaplan:1992bt} and 
\emph{overlap fermions} \citep{Neuberger:1997fp,Neuberger:1998wv}.

\section{Scale setting and the continuum limit} \label{sec-scale_setting}

We previously mentioned that the lattice spacing $a$ works as a non-perturbative
regulariser of the theory, and thus sets the internal scale. Any parameter in
the lattice theory appears as dimensionless combinations, such as $\vec{x}/a$,
$a \vec{p}$, $a m$, $a^{3/2} \psi(x)$. The scale is therefore to some extent
hidden, and the only way to access it is by computing observables and comparing
them to experimental values
%
\begin{equation}
  \lim_{a \to 0} O(m, g; a) = O_{\text{phys}}.
\end{equation}
%
Simply sending $a$ to $0$ is considered to be the \emph{naive} continuum limit,
as one fails to take into account the parameters' dependence on the scale. The
parameters that enter our theory is called \emph{bare}, as they vary together
with the scale
%
\begin{equation}
  m_{\text{phys}} = \lim_{a \to 0} m_{\text{bare}}(a), \hskip2em
  g_{\text{phys}} = \lim_{a \to 0} g_{\text{bare}}(a).
\end{equation}
%
The dependence of your parameters on the scale can be summarised by the
Callan-Symanzik equations, which can be computed for any physical observable
$O_{\text{phys}}$
%
\begin{equation}
  a \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} a} O_{\text{phys}}
    = \Big( \frac{\partial}{\partial a} 
      - \beta \frac{\partial}{\partial g}
      - \gamma \frac{\partial}{\partial m}
    \Big) O_{\text{phys}} = 0.
\end{equation}
%
The $\beta$-function describes how much the coupling changes as a function of
the lattice spacing, and can for instance be calculated through perturbation
theory. To lowest order in the coupling we get
%
\begin{align}
  \beta(g) = - a \frac{\partial g}{\partial a} &= - \frac{g^3}{(4\pi)^2}
    \Big( \frac{11}{3} C_{\text{adj}\hskip.2ex 2} - \frac{4}{3} n_f C_R \Big) + \mathcal{O}(g^5), \nonumber\\
  &\equiv - \beta_0 g^3 + \mathcal{O}(g^5) \label{eq-beta_eq}
\end{align}
%
Here we encounter the group's Casmir operators, $C_R$ and $C_{R\hskip.2ex 2}$. They are
defined as
%
\begin{equation}
  C_{R \hskip.2ex 2} = || T_{Ri} f^{iab} f^{jba} T_{Rj}||, \hskip2ex
    C_R = \frac{d_R}{d_{\text{adj}}} C_{R \hskip.2ex 2},
\end{equation}
%
and take the following values for the fundamental representation of SU($N$)
%
\begin{equation}
  C_F = \frac{1}{2}, \hskip1em C_{\text{adj}\hskip.2ex 2} = N \,.
\end{equation}
%
One can solve the differential equation in \meqref{eq-beta_eq} and get
%
\begin{equation} \label{eq-running-coupling}
  g = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 2\beta_0 \log (a/a_0)}}
    \hskip1em\Leftrightarrow\hskip1em
    a = \frac{1}{\Lambda} \exp\Big\{\frac{-1}{2\beta_0 g^2}\Big\} .
\end{equation}
%
We see that although $g$ was initially dimensionless, we have generated an
energy scale $\Lambda$ through the renormalisation group. We also see that the
lattice spacing $a$ goes to zero as $g$ goes to zero (and the lattice coupling
$\beta$ goes to infinity). This is the \emph{true} continuum limit, where one, as
opposed to the naive limit, takes the change of the parameters into account.

\section{Numerical evaluation of lattice gauge theories}
\label{sec-numerical_eval}

Although the lattice discretisation has decreased the number of integrals in the
definition of $\mathcal{Z}$ from infinity to something finite, the number of free
variables is still too great for it to be evaluated, even numerically. The
fermion fields have $2 N_f d_R$ independent degrees of freedom at every
position. The gauge field is a four vector at every space-time point with
$d_{\text{adj}}$ degrees of freedom. Even though the fermion fields can be
integrated out exactly, this still leaves a highly dimensional integral if one
wants to look at anything but miniscule volumes.

The only feasible way to handle these types of integrals is by way of Monte
Carlo integration. This is a stochastic method that instead of summing over all
values the degrees of freedom can take, as one does in standard numerical
integration, only sample a small number of these configurations. The value of
the integral is then reconstructed using this (small) number of configurations.

For this to work well one has to sample the configuration space in an
intelligent way as the integrand is usually sharply peaked around a small set of
very specific configurations. A first step is to do importance sampling, where
one uses the integrand as a probability distribution for the configuration
space, in the case of the partition function
%
\begin{equation}
  P[\psi,\bar{\psi}, U_{\mu}] \sim e^{-\mathcal{S}[\psi,\bar{\psi}, U_{\mu}]}.
\end{equation}
%
Since direct sampling from the this distribution is not possible in practice,
one usually constructs a chain of samples, each being related to the previous
through a Markov chain
%
\begin{equation}
  \Big\{
    \big[\psi, \bar{\psi}, U_{\mu}\big]_1, 
    \big[\psi, \bar{\psi}, U_{\mu}\big]_2, ..., 
    \big[\psi, \bar{\psi}, U_{\mu}\big]_N
  \Big\}
\end{equation}
%
where the probability of getting one probability given another follows the
detailed balance equation
%
\begin{equation}
  \frac{%
    P\big([\,]_{n\hphantom{-1}} \big| [\,]_{n-1}\big)
  }{%
    P\big([\,]_{n-1} \big| [\,]_{n\hphantom{-1}}\big)
  } = e^{\mathcal{S}[\,]_{n-1} - \mathcal{S}[\,]_n} \,.
\end{equation}
%
Which will converge to the correct distribution as long as the chain is
\emph{ergodic}, i.e. will reach any field configuration in finite (albeit
arbitrary long) time.

\subsection{Observables}

Using this process to select a finite set of configurations, one can use this to
obtain an estimate for the expectation value of observables. 
Commonly named the \emph{ensemble average}, it is given by
%
\begin{equation}
  \bar{O}\big[\psi, \bar{\psi}, U_{\mu}\big] = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{n = 1}^N O\big( [\,]_n \big).
\end{equation}
%
If the set of configurations behave as described in the previous section, it
converges to the true average, \meqref{eq-expectation_value}, when $N \to
\infty$.

For any realisable number of configurations we want an estimate for the error.
This information is encoded in the \emph{autocorrelation function}
%
\begin{equation}
  C_{O}(m) = \big\langle O\big([\,]_n\big) O\big([\,]_{n+m}\big)\big\rangle_n
    - \big\langle O\big([\,]_n\big)\big\rangle_n^2\,,
\end{equation}
%
which quantize how correlated consecutive measurements are. Since the $n+1$'th
configuration depend on the $n$'s configuration through the Markov chain,
$C_O(m) \neq 0$ for $m > 0$. But it is how quickly this function decreases that
determine how good the estimate for the average is. An important quantity for
this is the \emph{integrated autocorrelation time}
%
\begin{equation}
  \tau_O = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{m=-\infty}^{+\infty} \frac{C_O(m)}{C_O(0)}.
\end{equation}
%
One can show that approximately $2 \tau_O$ of the consecutive measurements will
be correlated, meaning that it would be advantageous to only sample the
observable at this interval instead of for every new configuration
\citep[sect. 7.1.3]{montvay1997quantum}.
