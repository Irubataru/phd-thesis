\chapter{Statistical Mechanics and Phase Transitions}

In this chapter we will give a short overview of some aspects of statistical
mechanics that are important to the present work in \secref{sec-stat-mech}.
Then the field theoretical equivalent is given in
\secref{sec-thermal-field-theory}, before we once more study the discretised
theory in \secref{sec-thermal-lattice-theory}. We tie up the chapter 
in \secrefs{sec-finite-density-lattice,sec-sign-problem} with a
thorough discussion of simulations of finite density systems, and the hurdles
that need to be overcome.

Several volumes of the standard literature has been consulted with respect to
the contents of this chapter. These include, but are not limited to,
\cite{landau2013statistical,pathria2011statistical} for introductions to
statistical mechanics, and \cite{kapusta2006finite} with an introduction to
Thermal Field Theory (\emph{TFT}).

\section{Statistical mechanics} \label{sec-stat-mech}

Every quantity of interest to anyone studying equilibrium thermodynamics is
encoded into the previously mentioned partition function
%
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{Z} = \sum_i \mathcal{Z}_i = \sum_i e^{-\beta E_i} \,.
\end{equation}
%
The sum goes over all states of the degrees of freedom of the system with $E_i$
being the energy cost of the configuration, and $\beta = 1/T$ is the reciprocal
temperature. How one chooses to define the scope of these \emph{states} depends
on the physics one is interested in obtaining, as all choices should in the end
be independent, although different physical quantities are easier to extract in
some rather than others. Three common descriptions are the
\emph{microcanonical}-, \emph{canonical}- and \emph{grand canonical} ensembles.
They differ in their scope as the microcanonical ensemble includes systems at a
fixed energy shell, the canonical ensemble a system of fixed temperature and
particle number while the grand canonical ensemble also allows for fluctuations
in particle numbers.

Both the canonical- and grand canonical ensembles have associated partition
functions, and the two can be related through a simple relation
%
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{Z}_{\text{GC}}(z, V, T) = \sum_{N=0}^{\infty} z^N \mathcal{Z}_{\text{C}}(N, V, T),
\end{equation}
%
where $z = e^{\beta \mu}$ is the fugacity, $\mu$ being the chemical
potential. The partition function can in turn be used to calculate a multitude
of thermodynamic quantities
%
\begin{align}
  P &= \frac{1}{\beta} \bigg( \frac{\partial}{\partial V} \log \mathcal{Z}
    \bigg)_{\beta,z} \\
  \langle E \rangle &= \hphantom{\frac{1}{\beta}} \bigg( \frac{\partial}{\partial \beta}
    \log \mathcal{Z} \bigg)_{z,V} \\
  \langle N \rangle &= \;z\; \bigg( \frac{\partial}{\partial z}
    \log \mathcal{Z} \bigg)_{\beta,V}
\end{align}

\subsection{Phases and phase transitions}

The phase of a system is linked to the characteristic behaviour of one or more
of its physical quantities, such as the magnetisation of spin glasses, the
average positions of atoms in a crystal and the molecular composition of
solutions. We refer to this defining physical physical quantity as the
\emph{order parameter} of the phase.  The transition between two or more phases
are known as \emph{phase transitions}, and due to the very nature of phases,
happen through the induction of mathematical singularities. 

The order of a phase transition is exactly described by which derivative of the
free energy with respect to the order parameter of choice diverge. First order
transitions have discontinuous first derivatives, while only higher order
derivatives diverge for second order transitions.

However, if the order parameter tends towards zero, but never quite reaches it,
one can define a pseudo-phase transition, known as a \emph{crossover}, to be the
point of the most rapid change. While this is not a real phase transition,
following its trajectory in a phase diagram will result in one if one exists,
linking the two concepts.

Phase transitions is an inherently macroscopic concept, and does not know about
the microscopic details of the theory. Theories with different microscopic
details might therefore still behave alike on the macroscopic level. These
categorise into \emph{universality classes}, catalogued by the singular
behaviour of their physical quantities close to the transition. If we denote the
order parameter by $m$, and the ordering field by $h$\footnote{a characteristic
variable which define the transition, $m\to0$ as $h\to0$}, we can define some of
the critical exponents by
%
\begin{align}
  m \;&\sim (T - T_c)^{\beta}, \\
  \bigg(\frac{\partial m}{\partial h}\bigg)_{\mathrlap{T}} &\sim (T - T_c)^{-\gamma}, \\
  C_V = - \beta^2 &\bigg(\frac{\partial^2 \mathcal{F}}{\partial
    \beta^2}\bigg)_{\mathrlap{V}} \sim (T - T_c)^{-\alpha}.
\end{align}
%
Systems which have the same critical exponents fall into the same universality
class. A notable example is the $4D$ Ising model whose critical exponents are
$\alpha = 0$, $\beta = 1/2$, and $\gamma = 1$.

\subsection{Yang Lee zeros}

An alternative approach to a rigorous study of the phase transitions was
proposed by Yang and Lee \citep{Yang:1952be,Lee:1952ig}. They suggested that one
can analyse the properties of the thermodynamic functions around a transition by
studying the zeros of the grand canonical partition function in the complex
fugacity-plane.

Seeing as the partition function can be interpreted as the normalisation of a
statistical probability function, it can never be zero for real and positive
values of $z$. However, as one increases the volume of the system, the number of
zeros increases, and tends to a continuous curve in the thermodynamic limit,
$V\to\infty$. As this curve forms, zeros on the positive and negative imaginary
axis could tend towards meeting at the real axis, signalling the onset of a
phase transition.
